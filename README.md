# Icuerus
Icuerus will allow you to cue music in theatrical plays or at other events which require similar functionality. It is built with HTML5, JavaScript and CSS, which makes it cross-platform and easily accesible. The functionality of Icaudio includes hotkeys, looping, fading and seeking. It also allows for saving and loading JSON files.

This was a quick project that I made for a school play I took part in. It was successfully used at the performance.

## Usage
Sound files are loaded with the "Choose File" button in the top left of the screen.
Fades can be set by typing a number in the appropriate field and can be activated by clicking the button.
Hotkeys can be set by typing any character in the hotkey field.
The sound will loop when the checkbox is checked.

The current settings can be saved by hitting the save-button and choosing a filename.
To load the file, click "load" and navigate to the previously saved file and open it.
The saved file does not contain the sounds: they must be loaded independently before loading the json file.
